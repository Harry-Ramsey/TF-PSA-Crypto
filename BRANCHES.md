One branch is maintained:

- [`development`](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/psa-crypto/tree/development)

The development of the PSA cryptography repository code occurs on the
development branch. No cryptography code development occurs on this branch
though. The development branch just contains a framework, a CMake build system
and scripts to integrate the Mbed TLS implementation of the PSA cryptography
API into this repository.
